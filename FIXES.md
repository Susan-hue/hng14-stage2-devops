This document records every bug found in the starter repository, including the file, line number, nature of the problem, and the fix applied.

## Fix 1 — Hardcoded Redis hostname in API

**File:** `api/main.py`  
**Line:** 8  
**Problem:** The Redis client was created with `host="localhost"`, which works when running directly on a host machine but fails when the service runs inside a Docker container. Containers cannot reach each other via `localhost`; they communicate using Docker's internal DNS, resolved by service name.  
**Fix:** Replaced `host="localhost"` with `host=os.environ.get("REDIS_HOST", "redis")` so the hostname is read from an environment variable, with `"redis"` as the default (matching the Docker Compose service name).

---

## Fix 2 — Redis password never used in API connection

**File:** `api/main.py`  
**Line:** 8  
**Problem:** The `.env` file defined `REDIS_PASSWORD`, but the `redis.Redis(...)` constructor in `main.py` did not pass a `password` argument. If Redis is configured to require authentication, the connection would be rejected with an `AUTHFAILED` error.  
**Fix:** Added `password=os.environ.get("REDIS_PASSWORD")` to the Redis constructor call.

---

## Fix 3 — Hardcoded Redis hostname in worker

**File:** `worker/worker.py`  
**Line:** 6  
**Problem:** Same issue as Fix 1. The worker used `host="localhost"`, which breaks in a containerised environment.  
**Fix:** Replaced with `host=os.environ.get("REDIS_HOST", "redis")` and also added `port=int(os.environ.get("REDIS_PORT", 6379))`.

---

## Fix 4 — Redis password never used in worker connection

**File:** `worker/worker.py`  
**Line:** 6  
**Problem:** Same issue as Fix 2. The worker connected to Redis without sending the password.  
**Fix:** Added `password=os.environ.get("REDIS_PASSWORD")` to the Redis constructor call.

---

## Fix 5 — Unused import in worker

**File:** `worker/worker.py`  
**Line:** 4  
**Problem:** `import signal` was present but the `signal` module was never used anywhere in the file. This is dead code and would cause a `flake8` lint failure (F401: imported but unused).  
**Fix:** Removed the unused `import signal` line.

---

## Fix 6 — Hardcoded API URL in frontend

**File:** `frontend/app.js`  
**Line:** 6  
**Problem:** `const API_URL = "http://localhost:8000"` was hardcoded. When the frontend runs inside a Docker container, `localhost` refers to the frontend container itself, not the API container. The API would be unreachable, causing all job submission and status requests to fail.  
**Fix:** Replaced with `const API_URL = process.env.API_URL || "http://api:8000"` so the URL is read from an environment variable, defaulting to the Docker Compose API service name.

## Fix 7 — Real credentials committed to the repository

**File:** `api/.env`  
**Line:** 1  
**Problem:** The `.env` file containing `REDIS_PASSWORD=supersecretpassword123` was committed to the repository. Committing secrets to version control is a critical security vulnerability.  
**Fix:** Removed `api/.env` from git tracking using `git rm --cached api/.env`, added `.env` to `.gitignore`, and created `api/.env.example` with placeholder values to document required variables without exposing secrets.

---

## Fix 8 — Missing .gitignore

**File:** `.gitignore` (missing — did not exist)  
**Line:** N/A  
**Problem:** The repository had no `.gitignore` file, meaning `.env` files, `__pycache__`, `node_modules`, and other generated files could be accidentally committed.  
**Fix:** Created a `.gitignore` at the repository root with at minimum `.env` listed to prevent secret files from being tracked.

---

## Fix 9 — Unpinned dependency versions in API

**File:** `api/requirements.txt`  
**Lines:** 1–3  
**Problem:** All three dependencies (`fastapi`, `uvicorn`, `redis`) had no version pins. This breaks reproducibility — a fresh `pip install` at a later date could pull in a breaking newer version and fail silently.  Also, `uvicorn` was listed without the `[standard]` extras, missing performance-critical dependencies (`uvloop`, `httptools`).  
**Fix:** Pinned all versions (`fastapi==0.104.1`, `uvicorn[standard]==0.24.0`, `redis==5.0.1`). Created a separate `api/requirements-test.txt` for test-only dependencies (`pytest`, `httpx`, `pytest-cov`) to keep production and test dependencies cleanly separated.

---

## Fix 10 — Unpinned dependency version in worker

**File:** `worker/requirements.txt`  
**Line:** 1  
**Problem:** `redis` had no version pin, creating the same reproducibility problem as Fix 9.  
**Fix:** Pinned to `redis==5.0.1` to match the version used by the API service.

## Fix 11 — Hardcoded port in frontend server

**File:** `frontend/app.js`  
**Line:** 30 
**Problem:** The port was hardcoded as `3000` directly in `app.listen(3000, ...)`. This means the port can never be changed without editing source code, which is bad practice for a containerised service where configuration should come from environment variables.  
**Fix:** Replaced with `const PORT = process.env.PORT || 3000;` and updated the listen call to `app.listen(PORT, ...)` so the port is configurable via environment variable with `3000` as the default.
